# Dataproject

In this dataproject, we import data from Denmark's statistics on disposable income on the municipal level for men and women. We sort the data to focus on specific parts of the dataset, and style the results to better visualise the data. Further, we use the data to find the percentage difference in men and womens disposable income. We visualise this graphically using plots, to improve the analysis of the data. Finally we plot the numbers in normal distributions to see which gender had the highest starting point, and which gender has moved the most through the years.

We assume that the dst API is already installed, otherwise it can be done from following path: pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst
