# Dataproject

In this dataproject, we import data from Statestikbanken on disposable income on the municipal level for men and women, sort the data to focus on specific parts of the dataset, and style the results to better visualise the data. Further, we use the data to find the percentage difference in men and womens wages. We visualise this graphically using normal distributions, to improve the analysis of the data. Finally we comment on our results, and find that men has a higer mean wage but higher varians then women. '
