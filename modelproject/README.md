# Modelproject

In this project we start by solving the basic Solow model. We then visualize the findings in an example with reasonable values, to show how to find the steady state. After this we make an interactive figure in which you can change the parameters yourself, to see how they influence the steady state.
Next, we solve an extension of the basic Solow model - the Solow model with human capital. We derive the real rental rate and real wage, so we can compare them to the basic Solow model. After this we solve for the steady state values. Furthermore we visualize our findings graphically with reasonable values for the parameters. Finally, we make another interactive figure in which you can play around with the parameters to improve the understanding on how they influence the steady states.
